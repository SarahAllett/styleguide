# Testing

We have removed the default test suite, "Minitest" and have installed RSpec.
Rspec is the default test suite for all our Rails App.


Current test include:

* **Controllers** – checking the http status status and layout page being used
* **Selenium** – browser testing using selenium web driver
* **Views** – checking the correct template, partials and content are being loaded
